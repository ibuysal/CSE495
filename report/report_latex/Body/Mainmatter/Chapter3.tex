\chapter{Conclusions}
The project has demonstrated that the final position of the target UAV can be successfully estimated using its trajectory and starting position, even in environments with GPS noise. The CNN model, developed and tested in a simulation environment, achieved an average error distance of 0.51 meter between the predicted and actual positions, meeting the project’s success criteria.

The model’s architecture and performance indicate that it can be further enhanced and tested under different scenarios by incorporating additional training data. This project has validated the feasibility of location estimation in noisy GPS environments by minimizing the reliance on extensive flight data from the target UAV.
