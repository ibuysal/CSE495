\chapter{Introduction}

This project focuses on developing a system to predict target UAV's relative position based on observer UAV. The main goal is to improve the accuracy of localization of UAV.

The system uses a preprocessing pipeline that extracts trajectory information from images captured during UAV movement. These images are processed to create inputs for a prediction model, which also considers  initial UAV positions. The model then predicts the target UAV's relative position.

Testing was conducted in a simulation environment with various conditions, including different noise levels and different inital poisitons. The results showed that the system predicts target UAV's relative position with high accuracy, even in challenging scenarios. The errors between predicted and real trajectories were analyzed to evaluate the performance of the model.

This project demonstrates a practical approach to using prediction models for UAV trajectory tracking. It can be useful in applications such as autonomous navigation and aerial monitoring.
