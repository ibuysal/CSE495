The accurate localization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is crucial for various applications, including surveillance, disaster response, and environmental monitoring. However, localization is often challenged by GPS inaccuracies, especially in complex environments. This project presents a novel approach to localizing a target UAV by employing an observer UAV equipped with a stationary camera. The observer UAV captures the target UAV's trajectory through video footage, allowing for the estimation of its local coordinates without direct GPS dependence.

A simulation environment was developed to emulate the flight of both UAVs under realistic GPS noise conditions. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model was trained using datasets generated from the simulation, enabling precise prediction of the target UAVâ€™s position based solely on visual data. The model was then deployed within the simulation to evaluate its performance in real-time localization tasks.

The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves reliable localization accuracy despite significant GPS noise, serving as a good example in the field of vision-based localization systems for UAV operations.
