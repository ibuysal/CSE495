    ReLU & : & Rectified Linear Unit, an activation function that outputs the input if it is positive and zero otherwise. \\
    Tanh & : & Hyperbolic Tangent, an activation function with outputs ranging from -1 to 1. \\
    ELU & : & Exponential Linear Unit, an activation function that allows smoother gradients for negative inputs. \\
    NED & : & North-East-Down, a coordinate system used for defining positions in UAV systems. \\
    UAV & : & Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, commonly referred to as a drone. \\
    MED & : & Mean Euclidean Distance, a metric for measuring the average distance between predicted and actual values. \\
    $\alpha$ & : & A parameter controlling the slope for negative inputs in Leaky ReLU and ELU functions. \\
    GPS & : & Global Positioning System, a satellite-based navigation system. \\
    ML & : & Machine Learning, a field of artificial intelligence focused on enabling systems to learn and improve from experience. \\
